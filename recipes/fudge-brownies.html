        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Our readers repeatedly tell us that this is the best brownie recipe they've tried, and honestly, we see why.
            What
            makes this recipe so special is that we mix hot butter with sugar and cocoa powder.
            While this seems simplistic, it's why these brownies turn out so fudgy, taste like rich chocolate,
            and have that gorgeous crackly top.<br>

            I bet you already have everything you need sitting in your kitchen to make them. Plus, you'll make the
            batter
            right in the saucepan used to melt your butter,
            so you won't even have many dirty dishes to clean when you are done. If you reach
            for darker chocolate over milk chocolate and love that fudgy texture, these brownies arefor you.<br><br>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <p>Remember, mixing HOT butter with sugar and cocoa powder is the secret to the best brownies. The heat from the
            butter brings out the rich chocolate flavor of the cocoa and
            begins to melt the sugar, which then helps create that beautiful, shiny top after baking.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325°F (162°C). Line the bottom and sides of
                an
                8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to
                help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>

            <li>Add the butter to a medium saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and cook until the butter melts
                completely,
                then turn off the heat. Stay close, and do not let it brown.</li>

            <li>While the butter is hot, stir in the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Stir well until blended.
                Don't
                worry if the batter looks gritty. Once you add the eggs, the brownie batter will become smooth.</li>

            <li>Set the saucepan aside to cool until the mixture is warm, not hot, 5 to 10 minutes. Test the temperature
                by
                touching the batter, it should be comfortable to hold without feeling hot.</li>

            <li>Add the cold eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each egg.</li>

            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the
                batter
                until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. I use a wooden spoon or spatula and
                beat
                for 40 to 50 strokes</li>

            <li>Stir in nuts or chocolate chips (optional).</li>

            <li>Spread the thick brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan. It can be hard to spread because it is so
                thick.
                Do your best to push the batter to the corners and even out the top.</li>

            <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle is slightly underbaked, 20 to 30 minutes. A
                toothpick plunged into the center should emerge somewhat moist with batter. As the brownies cool, they
                firm
                up but will always be moist and fudgy in the middle.</li>

            <li>Cool completely before removing the brownies from the pan (this step is essential and helps the brownies
                set). Cut into 16 squares. For clean edges, use a chef's knife and wipe it clean after each slice. For
                guaranteed perfect edges, chill the brownies in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours before slicing.</li>
