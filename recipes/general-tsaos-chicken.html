    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was voted one of the top 10 dishes in Columbus by Columbus Monthly Magazine, as prepared by Chef Paul
        Kaewprasart of the Siam Oriental Restaurant. I modified it slightly, and it goes great over white rice as a main
        dish for any number of people.<br>
